Provide certain services for urban public facilities cleaning, public street cleaning and community environmental protection. In smart cities, a large number of public facilities system, insufficient human resource supervision and insufficient labor force organization and cleaning have become an important issue in urban sanitation development[1]. To achieve smart sanitation, we designed a smart toilet. It use infrared sensors to detect the number of people entering. The camera is used to identify people and detect the toilet environment. The information will be uploaded to the cloud, and the manager can change it in time according to the data[2]. In this way, the sanitation of public toilets can be maximized while the utilization of public toilets can be enhanced and unnecessary manpower input can be reduced. While paying attention to the sanitation of urban public facilities, we also pay attention to the problem of garbage sorting in cities. Classification is difficult, difficult to clean up, blame, urban garbage classification in operation encountered the above problems.

It is an intelligent solution built on the Internet of Things and Internet technology platform, integrating big data, cloud computing, and other emerging technologies, and carrying out real-time management of the whole process of people, cars, things, and things involved in sanitation management[3]. The purpose of smart city is to reduce the cost of sanitation operation and improve the efficiency and quality of sanitation operation.The development of smart sanitation in China has the necessity and its own initiative. For its necessity, in recent years, China\u2019s sanitation industry has developed rapidly, the incineration of urban household garbage and the comprehensive utilization of urban kitchen waste has come to a new turning point, which requires industrial upgrading. At present, sanitation drags back the construction of smart cities, and the intelligent upgrading of sanitation industry has become an important issue of smart city construction, and the development of smart sanitation industry is the need of smart city construction.At the same time, smart sanitation can effectively connect with smart city network and provide managers and operators with required services and data at any time in the form of cloud services[4]. However, filthy public toilets, rubble-strewn streets, and, loud noise are evidence that sanitation is not growing fast enough to keep up with urban development. The current level of sanitation does not meet the requirements of smart cities. The cleaning of public facilities and the supervision of community environmental protection are lack of effective management and supervision. Our group hopes to promote the construction of smart sanitation by designing products. At the same time, we consider the platforming of smart sanitation control and data resource utilization. Platform-based management is the inevitable result of the development of DT era. Big data will become an important resource, which is not only a means to improve efficiency within the industry, but also the result of integrating resources inside and outside the industry to develop new values. Therefore, in addition to considering the technical issues of product design, we also try to build information exchange platforms such as Wechat mini program platform to promote the integration of information resources.The emergence of edge computing provides a new compute paradigm for multimedia streaming that the videos will be cached and processed at the distributed edge servers for providing some services. In the Smart city, numerous videos generated by cameras can be a problem and challenge for servers[5]. In this way, the end-to-end latency, bandwidth consumption, and energy consumption can be reduced when streaming. We propose a framework that optimize both the caching and transmitting with edge computing. We formulate the optimization problem that considers both the service quality maximization and cost minimization. We then solve it effectively with Lyapunov optimization and subgradi-ent descent. We have conducted comprehensive experiments and the results demonstrated the superiority of our solution[6]. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Our smart toilet system and trash can are presented in section 2 and 3.
